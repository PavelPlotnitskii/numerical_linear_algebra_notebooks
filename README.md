# IPython notebooks on numerical linear algebra

This is a small collection of notebooks illustrating concepts in numerical linear algebra.
They were created as part of the Fall 2014 course AMCS 251 at KAUST.  They are meant to
accompany a reading of [Numerical Linear Algebra](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/text.html)
by Trefethen & Bau.
